# django-generic-plus

**django-generic-plus** is a python module which provides a Django model field
that combines the functionality of GenericForeignKey and FileField into a single field.

It is useful in situations where one wishes to associate metadata with a
FileField or ImageField. It is currently used by [django-cropduster](https://github.com/theatlantic/django-cropduster).
